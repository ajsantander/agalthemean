[UPDATE 2016]
This project was an experiment from 2011 and has since been dead, but it is a useful utility.

An experimental real time AGAL editor based on Minimole. Experimental as in not intended to be a finished product, but rather a tool for myself for experimenting and learning AGAL.

Project can be ran:
- with a browser with a flash plugin, open build/AGALTheMean.html
- with air sdk, run following following command line ``adl -screensize 1080x1920:1080x1920 app.xml``

Project was done in flex SDK4 and is compatible with AS3.
To compile refer to the Makefile.
